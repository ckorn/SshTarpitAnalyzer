# SshTarpitAnalyzer
Analyze the logfile of ssh-tarpit.

Currently you have to upload the logfile to a pastebin service and enter the raw url.
There is some problem with file uploads which I have to fix first.
Shows the number of connections and a chart with the time they have spend in the tarpit.

Has an UI in WinForms (not maintained, just for testing) and Blazor (still need to learn that^^)
